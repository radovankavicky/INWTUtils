## Overview

This vignette describes how to check your code files for a good style
with `checkStyle` (a wrapper for the `lint` function of the
`lintr` package). The function is tailored to the usage at the INWT Statistics
company but can by applied in other contexts without any disadvantages.

For several so-called *lints* the function checks if they appear in the code.
In this context, lints are (mostly small) violations of style rules, e.g.,
missing spaces around operators, double spaces, very long lines or trailing
blank lines.
A function checking a specific lint is called linter function.
The section "Included linters" gives more information about the set of tested lints. 


## Why should you watch your style?

Your code may be robust and fast in spite of a bad style. But a good style
makes your code more beautiful and easier to read -- especially for others.
Adapting a consistent style within a team helps to find your way around in the code
written by someone else.

It's never to late to adapt a good coding style -- and never to early.


## How to use `checkStyle`

`checkStyle` can be applied to one or more files. If you don't add any other
argument, the default set of linters is used as returned by the function
`selectLinters`. To demonstrate the usage, we first create two files with
examples for bad style:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(INWTUtils)
```

```{r badStyleFile, eval = FALSE}
writeLines(c("# This is an example for bad style",
             "x = 1+2",
             "# A comment with  double  spaces",
             ""),
           con = "badStyle1.R")
writeLines(c("# This is a second example   ",
             "z<-c(1,2)"),
           con = "badStyle2.R")
```

How many violations of common style conventions do you see? `checkStyle` may
find some more:

```{r checkStyle, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
checkStyle(files = c("badStyle1.R", "badStyle2.R"))
```

A new tab opens in RStudio which lists all lints found in the checked files.
It contains the full filepaths and a list with line numbers and
lints for each file. You can start to edit the code and repeat the check
until the opened tab remains empty.

If you want to customize the set of used linters, there are
three possibilities:

- Specify a file type with the `type` argument
- Exclude linters with the `excludeLinters` argument
- Add more linters with the `addLinters` argument

These arguments are passed to `selectLinters` and change the set of linters that
the function returns.

Specifying a file type via the `type` argument adds some linters to the set of
used linters.
You can choose between scripts (`type = "script"`) or files with package 
functions (`type = "pkgFuns"`). Or you can just ignore the argument.

`excludeLinters` just needs a vector or list with names of the linters you want
to exclude.
`addLinters` needs a bit more: a named vector or named list of linters. How you
choose the exact names doesn't play a role, but the values have to be linter
functions from an attached package.

For example:

```{r checkStyleArgs, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
checkStyle(files = c("badStyle1.R", "badStyle2.R"),
           type = "script",
           excludeLinters = c("object_length_linter",
                              "args_without_default_first_linter"),
           addLinters = list(setwd_linter = setwd_linter,
                             a = source_linter))
```


## Included linters

The following linters are used by default:

```{r lintersAlways, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
cat("-", paste0(names(INWTUtils:::generalLinters()), collapse = "\n\n- "))
```

If `type = "script"`, no linters are added at the moment.

```{r lintersScript, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
cat("-", paste0(names(INWTUtils:::scriptLinters()), collapse = "\n\n- "))
```

If `type = "pkgFuns"`, the following linters are added:

```{r lintersFuns, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
cat("-", paste0(names(INWTUtils:::pkgFunLinters()), collapse = "\n\n- "))
```

The following linters stem from the `INWTUtils` package:

`args_without_default_first_linter` checks if arguments without default value
are listed before arguments with default value in function definitions.

`double_space_linter` checks for double empty spaces.

`internal_function_linter` checks for the use of internal functions via `:::`. 
There is usually a reason why an internal function has not been exported. It
has probably not been tested properly outside the context it is used in.

`sapply_linter` checks for use of the sapply function. Since `sapply_linter`
does automatic simplification, you do not have full control over the output
format. If the input changes, this can have unexpected effects.

`setwd_linter`, `source_linter`, and `options_linter` check for `setwd`,
`source` resp. `options` statements because they can cause side effects when
used in functions.

`trailing_whitespaces_linter` looks for superfluous whitespaces at the end of
a line. [^a]

The remaining linters are taken from the `lintr` package.
Details can be found via
[`?lintr::linters`](https://rdrr.io/cran/lintr/man/linters.html).


## Exclude lines from checking

Sometimes you may want to exclude specific lines from the check because the
found lint cannot be removed for some reason. You achieve this by adding the
`nolint` commands into the file to be checked (see also 
[`?lintr::exclude`](https://rdrr.io/cran/lintr/man/exclude.html)):

```{r nolint, eval = FALSE}
# nolint start
x <- c(1,2) # This line will be excluded from the checks
# nolint end
y <- c(3, 4) # This line won't be excluded anymore.
```


```{r rmFiles, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', eval = FALSE}
lapply(c("badStyle1.R", "badStyle2.R"), unlink)
```


[^a]: This linter is very similar to `trailing_whitespace_linter` from the
`lintr` package, but it takes a special case into account: If you insert the
pipe operator `%>%` from the [dplyr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)
using the shortcut `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `m`, a whitespace is inserted behind it
per default. These whitespaces are not detected by `trailing_whitespaces_linter`
because it would lead to many annoying alarms.
